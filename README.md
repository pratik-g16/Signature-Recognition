Brief description of project :
	The aim of our project is to recognize the similarity between the given signs. 
We are using the lcs approach to find the similarities between the given signs. 
The input will be the two signs provided by the user. 
Our project will scan the two signs and then will apply the lcs algorithm to find the similarities.
The output will be an image/text showing the similar part of the sign.
The user can provide an image of any size thus implying no constraint on the pixels(width and height) of the image. 
We are implementing this project in python.
